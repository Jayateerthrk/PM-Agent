## Documentation
Overview:
The application generates a comprehensive competitor analysis and strategic recommendations report for a product. The process is broken down into several stages, each handled by a specialized agent.

Steps:

User Input:

The user enters a product name into the UI (via Streamlit).
Crew AI Workflow Initiation:

Once the "Generate Report" button is clicked, the app initializes the workflow.
The input (product name) is passed to the Crew AI system.
Agent Tasks Execution:
The workflow is composed of several tasks managed by different agents:

1. Competitor Analyst Agent:
Goal: Identify the main competitors for the product.
Task: Produce a competitor analysis document, including a SWOT analysis for each competitor.

2. Feature Comparison Specialist Agent:
Goal: Compare the product's features against its competitors.
Task: Generate a detailed feature comparison report, highlighting strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities.

3. Strategic Advisor Agent:
Goal: Provide strategic recommendations based on the analysis.
Task: Synthesize insights from the previous tasks and generate actionable recommendations along with a roadmap and resource guidance.
Final Report Generation:

The outputs from the agents are combined to form a final report.

This report is displayed in the UI and also converted into a downloadable PDF.

User Output:

The final report is shown on the Streamlit app.
A download button allows the user to save the report as a PDF with a dynamic filename.
